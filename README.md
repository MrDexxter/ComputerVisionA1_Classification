# Classification with Feature Descriptors (SIFT & ORB)

The files uses OpenCV pipelines to detect and describe the features of an image. It then uses classifiers like SVM and Random Forest to classify them.

## Needed Packages
You will need opencv, sklearn, numpy and matplotlib to run these files. You can install those packages from pip using the following code:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python
```

### File Information
The project contain two .ipynb files. One for Object dataset and other for flower dataset. You can run the jupyter notebooks using google colab or any other python IDLE.
